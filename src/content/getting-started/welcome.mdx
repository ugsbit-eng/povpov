# Welcome to P.O.V Sniper BOT

Welcome to the P.O.V Sniper BOT Knowledge Base! This comprehensive guide will help you master automated trading on Solana's decentralized exchanges.

## What is P.O.V Sniper BOT?

**P.O.V Sniper BOT** is a sophisticated automated trading system designed specifically for the Solana blockchain ecosystem. The name stands for **Price, Orderflow, Volume** — the three critical market signals our advanced algorithms analyze in real-time to execute profitable trades.

Our bot supports multiple trading strategies:

- **Grid Trading**: Automated buy-low, sell-high within defined price ranges

## Important Security Notes

⚠️ **Read This Carefully**

### Your Responsibility

**You control your private keys** — P.O.V Sniper BOT is non-custodial. This means:

- ✅ You have complete control of your funds
- ✅ We never have access to your wallet
- ❌ We cannot recover lost keys or seed phrases
- ❌ We cannot reverse or cancel transactions

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your seed phrase** with anyone, including our support team
2. **Use a dedicated trading wallet** separate from your main holdings
3. **Start with small amounts** to test strategies
4. **Enable hardware wallet** for maximum security
5. **Keep software updated** to latest version
6. **Use strong RPC providers** (Helius, QuickNode, or Triton recommended)

### Risk Disclosure

Cryptocurrency trading carries inherent risks:

- Market volatility can result in significant losses
- Smart contract bugs or exploits in DEX protocols
- Network congestion may delay transactions
- Slippage on low-liquidity pairs
- Rug pulls or scam tokens (always DYOR)

**Never invest more than you can afford to lose.**
