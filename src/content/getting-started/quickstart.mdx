# Quickstart Guide: Trading in 10 Minutes

This guide will get you from zero to your first automated trade in about 10 minutes. We'll skip the theory and focus on action.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- ‚úÖ A computer or VPS (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- ‚úÖ ~$50-100 worth of SOL (for testing)
- ‚úÖ Basic understanding of crypto wallets
- ‚úÖ 10 minutes of focused time

## Step 1: Install a Wallet (2 minutes)

We recommend **Phantom** for beginners.

### Option A: Phantom (Easiest)

1. Visit [phantom.app](https://phantom.app)
2. Click "Download" and install the browser extension
3. Open Phantom and click "Create New Wallet"
4. **CRITICAL**: Write down your 12-word seed phrase on paper
5. Store it somewhere safe (not on your computer)
6. Set a strong password

### Option B: Solflare (Advanced Users)

1. Visit [solflare.com](https://solflare.com)
2. Download and install
3. Create new wallet, save seed phrase
4. Enable hardware wallet support if you have Ledger

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning**: Your seed phrase is your money. If you lose it, your funds are gone forever. If someone steals it, they can drain your wallet instantly.

## Step 2: Fund Your Wallet (2 minutes)

You need SOL in your wallet to trade.

### Get SOL from an Exchange

1. Buy SOL on a centralized exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken)
2. Withdraw to your Phantom wallet address
3. Wait for confirmation (usually 1-2 minutes)

**Minimum amounts:**
- Testing: 0.5 SOL (~$50)
- Serious trading: 5+ SOL (~$500)

### Or Use a DEX On-Ramp

Some wallets support direct card purchases:
- Phantom: Click "Buy" in the app
- MoonPay, Ramp Network, or similar
- Higher fees (~3-5%) but faster

**Pro Tip**: Keep at least 0.1 SOL separate for transaction fees. Don't allocate your entire balance to trading.

## Step 3: Install P.O.V Sniper BOT (3 minutes)

### Quick Install (Recommended for Beginners)

Download the pre-built binary for your OS:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Download from releases page
https://github.com/povsniper/bot/releases/latest

# Extract pov-sniper-windows.exe
# Double-click to run
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Download from releases page
https://github.com/povsniper/bot/releases/latest

# Extract and run
chmod +x pov-sniper-macos
./pov-sniper-macos
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
wget https://github.com/povsniper/bot/releases/latest/pov-sniper-linux
chmod +x pov-sniper-linux
./pov-sniper-linux
```

### Docker Install (Recommended for VPS)

If you're running on a VPS:

```bash
docker pull povsniper/bot:latest
docker run -d --name pov-sniper \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  povsniper/bot:latest
```

The bot will start and open a web interface at `http://localhost:3000`

## Step 4: Connect Your Wallet (1 minute)

1. Open the bot's web interface (should auto-launch)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Select "Phantom" (or your wallet)
4. Approve the connection in the wallet popup
5. Verify your SOL balance is displayed correctly

**Troubleshooting:**
- If wallet doesn't connect, refresh the page
- Make sure Phantom is unlocked
- Check that you're on Solana Mainnet (not Devnet)

## Step 5: Configure Your First Strategy (2 minutes)

Let's set up a simple **Grid Trading** strategy on SOL/USDC.

### Quick Setup

1. Click "**Strategies**" in the sidebar
2. Click "**Create New Strategy**"
3. Select "**Grid Trading**" template
4. Fill in these values:

```
Strategy Name: My First Grid Bot
Trading Pair: SOL/USDC
Grid Size: 5 levels
Price Range: 
  - Lower: $95
  - Upper: $105
Investment per Grid: 0.1 SOL
Take Profit: 2% per trade
Stop Loss: 5% total drawdown
```

5. Click "**Save Strategy**"

### What This Does

This configuration will:
- Buy SOL when price drops to $95, $96, $97, $98, $99
- Sell SOL when price rises to $100, $101, $102, $103, $104, $105
- Each trade uses 0.1 SOL
- Profit from price oscillations in the $95-$105 range

## Step 6: Start Trading! (30 seconds)

1. Return to the strategy list
2. Find your "My First Grid Bot" strategy
3. Click the toggle switch to "**Active**"
4. Confirm the warning popup
5. Watch the live chart ‚Äî bot is now monitoring the market!

**First Trade Timeline:**
- The bot will wait for price to hit one of your grid levels
- This could be immediate or take hours (depends on volatility)
- You'll receive a Telegram notification when trades execute (setup notifications in Settings)

## What to Expect

### First Hour

- Bot monitors price every second
- No trades yet (unless price hits your grid levels immediately)
- Dashboard shows "Waiting for signal..."

### First Trade

- Price hits a grid level (e.g., drops to $97)
- Bot validates the signal (checks orderflow, volume)
- **Sends transaction** to your wallet for approval
- **You must approve** in Phantom (or enable auto-approve)
- Trade confirms in ~3 seconds
- Dashboard updates with new position

### Ongoing Operation

- Bot continues monitoring all grid levels
- Automatically rebalances as price moves
- Dashboard shows open positions, P&L, and trade history
- Notifications keep you informed (optional, but recommended)

## Quick Wins: Optimize Your First Day

### Enable Telegram Notifications

Stay updated without watching the dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Notifications**
2. Click "**Connect Telegram**"
3. Message the @POVSniperBot on Telegram
4. Enter the code shown in the bot UI
5. Choose notification preferences:
   - ‚úÖ Trade executed
   - ‚úÖ Stop loss triggered
   - ‚úÖ Daily summary
   - ‚ùå Every price check (too noisy)

### Set Up Auto-Approve (Optional)

Skip manual transaction approvals:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: Only enable this for dedicated trading wallets with limited funds.

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Wallet**
2. Enable "**Auto-Approve Transactions**"
3. Set maximum trade size (e.g., 1 SOL)
4. Transactions under this limit auto-execute

### Monitor Performance

After a few trades:

1. Check **Dashboard ‚Üí Performance**
2. Review:
   - Total trades executed
   - Win rate (% of profitable trades)
   - Average profit per trade
   - Total P&L (profit and loss)

## Common First-Day Issues

### "Insufficient funds for transaction"
- Keep at least 0.05 SOL for fees
- Don't allocate 100% of balance to trading

### "Slippage tolerance exceeded"
- Market moved too fast
- Increase slippage tolerance in strategy settings (carefully)

### "Wallet not responding"
- Unlock Phantom
- Refresh the bot's web interface
- Reconnect wallet

### "No trades after 24 hours"
- Price hasn't hit your grid levels
- Your range might be too narrow/wide
- Check live price vs. your configured range
